## Usage Instructions

- **Sign Up:** Navigate to /signup to register a new user account by filling in the username, first name, last name, email, and password fields. The application checks for form validity and displays error messages for issues like mismatched passwords.
- **Sign In:** After registering, go to /signin and log in with your username and password.
- **Authenticated Home:** Logged-in users are redirected to a home page with a personalized greeting. From this page, they can also sign out.
- **Sign Out:** Clicking the "Sign Out" button ends the userâ€™s session and redirects them to the home page.
